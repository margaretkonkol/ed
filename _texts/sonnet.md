#I

  - From **fairest** creatures we desire increase,
  - That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
  - But as the riper should by time decease,
  - His tender heir might bear his memory:
  - But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
  - Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
  - Making a famine where abundance lies,
  - Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
  - Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
  - And only herald to the gaudy spring,
  - Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
  - And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
  - {:.indent-2} Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
  - {:.indent-2} To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
